# LCC Ripper ðŸ”ª

As Jack would say: let's go by parts.

LCC Ripper is intended to slice a transmission line model built in ATPDraw into several sections of arbitrary length. This tool makes a fine addition to [ATP-Batlab](https://github.com/amaurigmartins/ATPBatlab) when carrying out parametric studies where the user is interested in varying the position where a disturbance occurs along a transmission line.
